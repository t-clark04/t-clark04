### About Me 🌐
My name is Tommy Clark, and I am a junior at the University of Notre Dame studying Applied and Computational Mathematics and Statistics (ACMS) 📈 with a minor in Data Science 📊. I am fascinated by all things data and hope to use every tool at my disposal to harness the power of ethically-sourced data analysis for the greater good. My research and career interests are broad, ranging from analysis in the public health sector to statistical work in sports and sports medicine to experimentation with post-quantum, public-key cryptosystems. 


### Research Experience 🌟
- **Undergraduate Research Assistant** - University of Notre Dame (Jan 2025 - Present)
  -  Conducting research with Dr. Catie Adamo into post-quantum, lattice-based cryptography over the course of the spring semester.
  -  Aim to implement more efficient encryption algorithms to ensure secure communications in the face of attacks from rapidly developing quantum computers and AI.
- **Scientific Research Experience Module** - University of Galway (Sept - Dec 2024)
  - Wrote functions in R to calculate, illustrate, and interpret a number of blood lactate markers as a measure of endurance in athletes, under the guidance of Dr. John Newell.
- **ACMS Sports Performance Research Assistant** - University of Notre Dame (May - July 2024)
  - Developed my own package in R Studio to execute D-studies from Generalizability Theory for a particular kind of kinematic data collected on Notre Dame varsity athletes.

 
### Projects 💻
- **Current**
  - Compiling a semester-long portfolio of web applications and other data science-related projects in my Introduction to Data Science class. Intended to showcase my proficiency in Python libraries like Streamlit and Seaborn, as well as my knowledge of Machine Learning, Large Language Models, and other advanced topics in the field of data science. (See [Clark-Data-Science-Portfolio](https://github.com/t-clark04/Clark-Data-Science-Portfolio).)
- **Past**
  - Utilized ggplot2, dplyr, plotly, rgl, and a number of other R packages to complete a semester-long visualization project on the causes and correlates of happiness.
  - Analyzed a Kaggle dataset containing Spotify Web API metrics for over 13,000 songs to attempt to explain variations in song popularity.
